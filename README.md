Convolutional Neural Network Based Optimization Approach for Wireless Resource Management

This repository contains the implementations of the following paper:

**M. H. Rahman**, M. M. Mowla, and S. Shanto "**[Convolutional Neural Network Based Optimization Approach for Wireless Resource Management](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9333532),**" _2020 2nd International Conference on Advanced Information and Communication Technology (ICAICT)_, Dhaka, Bangladesh, 2020, pp. 280-285, doi: 10.1109/ICAICT51780.2020.9333532.

Requirements:

     1. Python 3.7
     2. Tensorflow 1.x
     3. Numpy
     4. Scipy

First generate the data (.mat) using `data-generator.py`, then run `main.py` for training and testing.

For further visualization, you can use `matplotlib`.
